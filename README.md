## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (used Figma for styling)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Used techniques:

- BEM
- Accessibility

But created with :heart:

### What I learned

I started using Figma. It let me gain style data for precise styling. I still am lack of practice, but I tend to use it in my new projects. 

### Continued development

- Keep using Figma.
- Keep using TypeScript.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.frontendmentor.io/articles/figma-for-developers-how-to-work-with-a-design-file-m6CZKZ1rC1) - Basics for Figma. It is good good start for beginners.
